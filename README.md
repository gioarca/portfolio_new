I show you today a project where you can read tons of different news with this small web-app.

Here's why I choose this:
* A project that solves a problem regarding the information and helps others to know more about the tech world
* It's easy to understand and you get a lot of information for free!
* You just have to open the web-app and follow the instructions included in it :smile:

Use the `index.html` to get started.
